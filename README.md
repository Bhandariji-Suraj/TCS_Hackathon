## Credit Risk Predictor

This project is a machine learning-based Credit Risk Prediction System that leverages the power of Machine Learning and interactive Jupyter widgets to classify loan applicants as high risk or low risk based on financial and demographic features.

## Features
✅ Preprocessing of categorical and numerical features

✅ One-hot and label encoding for categorical variables

✅ Machine Learning models prediction

✅ Interactive widgets to simulate real-time prediction

✅ Visualizations for better understanding of feature importance

## Model Used
1. Random Forest
2. Logistic Regression
3. XGBoost Classifer

## How to Use
1. Open the notebook: (credit-risk-predictor.ipynb)
2. Run each cell step-by-step to:
     a. Load data
     b. Clean and preprocess features
     c. Train the MachinLearning model
     d. Use interactive widgets to test predictions on custom inputs
     e. Use the sliders and dropdowns to input user data and see the prediction output instantly.

   
## Prediction Output
The model classifies an applicant as:

High Risk (1): Likely to default

Low Risk (0): Likely to repay
